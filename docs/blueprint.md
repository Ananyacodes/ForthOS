# **App Name**: ForthOS

## Core Features:

- Forth Kernel: Minimal Forth Kernel: Implement a basic Forth interpreter to serve as the kernel, managing system calls and hardware interactions.
- MicroPython Userland: MicroPython Userland: Provide a MicroPython environment for user-level applications, allowing execution of Python scripts on top of the Forth kernel.
- System Call Interface: System Call Interface: Implement a system call interface in Forth that allows MicroPython to request services from the kernel (e.g., I/O operations).
- Memory Management: Memory Management: Implement a simple memory management system in Forth to allocate and deallocate memory for both the kernel and MicroPython environments.
- Basic CLI: Basic Command-Line Interface: Provide a minimal command-line interface in MicroPython for basic interaction and execution of user commands.

## Style Guidelines:

- Monochromatic color scheme to reflect a retro computing environment
- Accent color: Dark green (#008000) for key elements and prompts.
- Fixed-width font for terminal-style output and code display
- Simple, full-screen terminal layout with clear separation of input and output.
